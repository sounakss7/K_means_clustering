## Overview

K-Means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into distinct clusters. Each cluster is represented by its centroid, and data points are assigned to the cluster with the nearest centroid. This repository provides a hands-on implementation of K-Means clustering and explores its application on real-world datasets.
